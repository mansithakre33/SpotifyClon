# SpotifyClon
This project is a frontend Spotify Clone developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the basic user interface and functionality of the Spotify web player. The application allows users to interact with a music playlist, control playback, and navigate tracks with a smooth and responsive user experience. The project focuses on strengthening core frontend concepts such as layout design, styling, and JavaScript-based DOM manipulation.
